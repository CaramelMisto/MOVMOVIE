After graduation, he gradually develops paranoid schizophrenia; but he cannot realize that he is sick. The chain of events changes when a psychiatrist suddenly appears before him during a conference. He is hospitalized and therefore moves away from his academic studies. When his illness reaches a point where he could harm his own child, his wife thinks he should go to the hospital again. Even though he cannot accept that he is sick for a long time, he realizes that the girl he sees all the time has never grown up. This makes him accept his illness. Nash will try to live with his imaginary realities by ignoring them. Even though the treatments he receives are not effective, he starts all over again with the support of his wife and former colleagues. He restrains his mental illness with his own mind and accelerates his academic studies again. He starts teaching at the university again. In the end, he continues his life with schizophrenia with his extraordinary struggle. And history presents this great genius with the Nobel Prize in Economics for overcoming his mental illness with his mind, devoting the rest of his life to science, and for the discoveries he made before the onset of his illness. </div>
