His specialty is extracting and stealing valuable secrets from deep within the subconscious during the dreaming moment, when the mind is most vulnerable. Cobb's rare prowess has made him a sought-after player in the dangerous new world of corporate espionage. However, it also made him an international fugitive and caused him to lose everything he loved. Cobb is offered an opportunity to escape his situation. One last job that could give him his life back; That is, if he can complete the impossible start... Instead of the perfect heist, Cobb and his team of professionals have to pull off the opposite this time; Their job is not to steal an idea but to plant it. If they succeed, it will be the perfect crime. But neither careful planning nor expertise can prepare them against dangerous enemies who seem to predict their every move. This is an enemy that only Cobb could see coming. </div>

In addition to Gaynor, the film also stars George O'Brien and Margaret Livingston. An urban woman, vacationing in the countryside, has an affair with a young, married local farmer and convinces the man to kill his wife and move to the big city with her. The man plans an 'accident' on the boat he and his wife will ride to the city, and hides a bunch of reeds in the boat to save himself from drowning. However, he does not have the heart to complete the plan and he rows and takes his wife to the shore. In great grief, they get on the tram and go to the city. Their tearful reconciliation ends in a church where a wedding is taking place. Having fallen in love with each other again, they visit first a photographer and then a barber. The man ignores the courtship of the manicurist at the barbershop and protects his wife from the attentions of a flirtatious admirer. After going to a huge amusement park and having fun, they return home by boat. However, a storm arises and the sail is torn. </div>
